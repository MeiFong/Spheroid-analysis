# Spheroid-analysis
This repository includes all scripts used in spheroid analysis.
There are two imageJ macros: 
  a. tiff_splitchannelsandsave.ijm - split image into different channel and save as maximum intensity projection format each.
  b. PlotProfile.ijm - plot fluorescent intensity profile for each maximum intensity projection image.
  
There are two R scripts to do data wrangling, data cleaning and analysis for MM649 and MM96L spheroids.
  a. Script_data cleaning, combine, graph, baseline_MM649_20221006.R
  b. Script_data cleaning, combine, graph, baseline_MM96L_20220810.R
